# Hand Strength Distribution

### Introduction 

Hand Strength Distribution shows what hand strength categories your range consists of on a given board and what percentage of hands is in each category. 

<code>Value</code>, <code>Marginal</code>, <code>Draw</code>, <code>Miss</code> are general categories that let you quickly assess range distribution. 

The sum of all categories is always equal to 100%, meaning that in our example below, if we add up <code>Straight</code>, <code>Set</code>, <code>Over Pair + AnyDraw</code>, ... , <code>Ace High</code> categories we'll get 100%. 

One hand always belongs to exactly one category. For example, <code>9T on 789 </code> cannot belong to two categories <code>Straight Draw</code> and <code>Top Pair</code>, instead it belongs to one category <code>Top Pair + AnyDraw</code>
