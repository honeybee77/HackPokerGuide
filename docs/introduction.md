# Introduction 

HackPoker is a powerful tool that can help with game analysis and strategy development. And yes you need to type to use it, :) which might be challenging at first, but it should become second nature in no time. </br>

Perhaps, you want to calculate equity 3way on T high board. No problem, just enter a command: </br>
<code>TT+ AT+ A5s+ vs top 3% vs 67s on T[2-9][2-9]</code>

<threeway-1/>


Notice how <code>vs</code> is used to separate ranges and <code>on</code> to specify a board. It is that simple and intuitive.</br>
What on earth is this <code>T[2-9][2-9]</code> you might be wondering ? :) Well that's how we specify ten high board. <code>[2-9]</code> are cards from deuce to nine.

You can calculate [Hand Strength Distribution](/hsd), create and save [Ranges](/uservariables/introduction) and more.
